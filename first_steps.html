*BASIC ELEMENTS

<p> paragraph - starts from the new line</p>

<h1> the biggest heading should always be used for the heading of the overall page </h1>

<h6> smallest heading </h6>


***     ***     ***     ***     ***     ***


<strong> text in bold </strong>

<em> text in italic - "emphasized" </em>

<!-- <strong> and <em> elements should be used instead of <b> and <i> for accessability, as <b> and <i> have no meaning just like big font text compared to <h1>, or any other heading, same look != same meaning-->
        
<!--
    relationships: 
    body = parent of p&p
    p&p = children of body and siblings of each other 
-->
<body>
    <p>child</p>
    <p>child</p> 
</body>

*LISTS

<!-- 
    <ol> organized list
    <ul> unorganized list
        <li> list item

    Do not use "type" attribute, as it has been deprecated; use the CSS "list-style-type" property instead.
-->
        
<!-- below list will start from no 4, then go for 5 for the 1nd item, 3rd item value is set to 10, so 4th will be equal 11
    *you can also use <ol reverse> to reverse numbers (high to low)-->
<ol start="4">
    <li>brush the teeth</li>
    <li>wash the dishes</li>
    <li value="10">eat a hamburger</li>
    <li>do homework</li>
</ol>

<!-- we can nest ol's and ul's as we want -->

*LINKS

<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Name of the link</a>

<!-- 
safe links: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer":
    -target="_blank" opens webpage in the new tab
    -rel stands for relation, that is between the current page and the linked document:
        -noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened
        -noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link (or 'reference') to it

destination:
    -relative - within our website, example - ./about.html :
        -same directory ./directory/directory/file 
        -upper director(ies) ../../folder/file
    -absolute - outside our website - must always include full https address (example above)
 -->

*IMAGES

<img src="./folder/folder/cat.png" alt="cutty cat">

<!-- 
<img> is a self closing element
attributes
    src - a source and can be relative, or absolute
    alt - alternative text - image description used with screen readers for visualy impared users / used whenever image cannot be loaded (some people use them wrongfully for cheeky positioning of their website)

main 4 formats of images you should use on the web:
    -.jpg (photos and images with lots of gradients)
    -.gif (simple animations, if you don't need animations - use png)
    -.png (icons, technical diagrams, logos)
    -.svg (Scalable Vector Graphics) (don't use at the begging as you may encounter issues)
-->

*GIT Commit Message ( https://cbea.ms/git-commit/ )

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
    -first line is treated as a title, also for the Git e-mails
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters (rule of thumb)
    -50 is a good rule, but 72 should be absolute max
    -any subject line longer than 72 characters will be trunncated by GitHub
3. Capitalize the subject line
    -always start the subject line with a capital letter
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
    -space is precious, no periods
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
    -"spoken or written as giving a command or instruction"
    -Git itself uses the imperative whenever it creates a commit on your behalf
    -a properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence:
    
        If applied, this commit will 'your subject line here'

        examples:                    'Refactor ubsystem X for readability'
                                     'update getting started documentation'
                                     'remove deprecated methods'
                                     'release version 1.0.0'
                                     'merge pull request #123 from user/branch'

6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
    -wrap means "start new line" after 72 characters (generally under 80 per line)
    -can use multiple lines in nthe body
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
    -focus on making clear the reasons why you made the change in the first placeâ€”
    the way things worked before the change (and what was wrong with that), the way they
    work now, and why you decided to solve it the way you did
